Ok, so this is gonna be a fun project I think. My goal is to actually make branches and document the making of this site.
I will try to do things following "Best Practices", or in the case of the first branch, it is gonna follow "Bost Practices".
- 1-create-base-project-structure
  - This is gonna follow some guidelines that Kevin Bost pointed me to in his github.com/keboo repo
  - First branch is just getting simple empty web application setup but with the central package management configured as well as a central place to manage the sdk/c# version to be used
  - There is also a global.json file that was added to make sure we stay on .net 8 since that is the LTS version at the moment (I may or may not upgrade to 9 when it is released, not sure yet)
