Ok, so this is gonna be a fun project I think. My goal is to actually make branches and document the making of this site.
I will try to do things following "Best Practices", or in the case of the first branch, it is gonna follow "Bost Practices".
- 1-create-base-project-structure
  - This is gonna follow some guidelines that Kevin Bost pointed me to in his github.com/keboo repo
  - First branch is just getting simple empty web application setup but with the central package management configured as well as a central place to manage the sdk/c# version to be used
  - There is also a global.json file that was added to make sure we stay on .net 8 since that is the LTS version at the moment (I may or may not upgrade to 9 when it is released, not sure yet)
- 2-add-aspire
  - This second step is going to add some of the initial steps for getting aspire working. This will be using version 9 rc 1 since that allows me to wait for the database to start up before proceeding with things
  - This will only add the basic extensions that are used as well as the app host, we will add migration application later once we start adding db elements
- 3-add-styling
  - This third step is a relatively small one since all we are going to do is add beercss as the styling library
  - We are going to try and only use the css elements for as long as possible, so even after pulling in the npm package, we will only copy over the css elements for now.
- 4-add-homepage-and-post-page-template
  - This branch will just start to add some of the beercss styling to the site
  - Will build out a main landing page with a link to the blog landing page
  - Will build out a basic blog listing landing page
  - Will build out a basic blog display page
- 5-add-authentication
  - This one will add some identity features to the application
  - One big piece this will now bring in as well is running with a database
  - This will also add in Audit Logging since we are putting database pieces into place
- 6-add-blog-post-editing
  - This will add the admin functionality for allowing us to add/edit/delete blog posts
  - When this is done, I will be moving this out to my main blog site and actually start doing some blogging with this beast (including turning this tutorial into a series of blog posts)
  - This will also add in some client side elements since we want to do the blog post editing through WASM instead of server side
